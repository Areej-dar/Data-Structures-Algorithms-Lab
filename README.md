# DSA Lab Exercises

This repository contains solutions for basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, including checking for palindrome strings and validating balanced expressions. These exercises were completed as part of a lab assignment in the Data Structures & Algorithm course.

## 💡 Project Overview

The lab assignment focuses on fundamental problems related to stack operations:

1. **Palindrome Checker**: 
   - Checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
   - Uses Python string slicing and a stack data structure for verification.

2. **Balanced Expression Validator**:
   - Validates if an expression has balanced parentheses (e.g., `()`, `{}`, `[]`).
   - Uses a stack to push opening braces and pop them when closing braces are encountered.
